PyPatternedCurrencyConverter : A Design Patterns-Powered Concurrency Converter in Python


## PyPatternedCurrencyConverter
PyPatternedCurrencyConverter is a Python-based currency converter program that utilizes several design patterns to provide a flexible, scalable, and maintainable codebase. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to convert currency values between various currencies.

The program is implemented using the following design patterns:

- Dependency Injection Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Strategy Pattern


The "Dependency Injection" pattern provides a decoupled design that allows for interchangeable components in the program. The "Factory" pattern simplifies the creation of objects in the program by providing a centralized method for creating objects. The "MVC" pattern separates the program's data model, user interface, and control logic, which allows for code reusability and easier maintenance. The "Observer" pattern provides a mechanism for objects to be notified of any changes in other objects, which enhances the program's scalability. The "Singleton" pattern ensures that there is only one instance of a class in the program. The "Strategy" pattern allows for interchangeable algorithms to be used for the currency conversion process.

PyPatternedCurrencyConverter is built using Python's Tkinter GUI library and utilizes the open-source currency exchange rate API, [ExchangeRatesAPI.io]([url](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)), to retrieve current currency exchange rates. The program supports over 30 different currencies, including USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, and AUD.

To run the program, simply download or clone the repository and run the design_pattern_you_want_gui.py file. The program's GUI will then launch, and you can enter your desired currency conversion values.

PyPatternedCurrencyConverter is ideal for anyone looking to learn about design patterns and their practical application in real-world Python programming. It is also useful for anyone who needs to convert currency values frequently and requires a reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use program.
